# Applied-Statistical-Methods-and-Causal-Analysis

## Background of project:
- Performed EDA on dataset to gain a better understanding of the data structure and identify key trends
- Evaluated suitability of empirical approaches such as linear regression, fixed effects, difference-in-difference to study the effects of a treatment effect on the response variable
- Constructing and testing of null hypothesis using the most ideal empirical approach
